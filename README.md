# Biodiesel_Reaction_Model
In this work, it was developed a mathematical model for enzymatic production of biodiesel. Intermediate enzymatic complexes were considered.
The chemical reactions and species in this model are:

- Tri: triacylglycerol (in this case, forrage raddish oil; it can release up to three chains to esther);
- Di: diacylglycerol 
- Mo: monoacylglycerol
- Est: esther (the wanted product of reaction)
- EtOH: ethanol
- Gli: glycerol (the ending point of Tri)
- E (enzyme; lipase from Burkholderia cepacia).

  Applying chemical reactions principles and after algeabric manipulation, the system of differential equations is:
